My dashboard finds this coffee shop had more sales from customers without loyalty cards than those with loyalty cards. 
My recommendation would be to focus on marketing strategies to increase loyalty card holders.

In order to perform a PivotTable analysis on coffee shop data, I gathered customer dating using the XLOOKUP function and product data using INDEX MATCH. 
To clean the data, I used the IF function to format blank columns, checked for duplicate data, and formatted the currency columns. 
My dynamic dashboard allows users to slice and view the data by different levels of granularity.
